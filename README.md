# Epigraphic Research Data as Source for Onomastics and Genealogy
## The Case of 'epidat' – Research Platform for Jewish Epigraphy

### Thomas Kollatz

#### abstract 
Epidat – the Research platform for Jewish Epigraphy contains about 190 digital editions of historic Jewish cemeteries with more than 35.000 inscriptions. The geographical focus is on Germany, The Netherlands, Lithuania and Czechia. The time span ranges from the mid 11th to the 20th century. 

In the epidat-platform the epigraphical sources are made available in various ways. In my lecture I will focus on epigraphy as well as Historical Jewish cemeteries as valuable source for genealogy and onomastics
